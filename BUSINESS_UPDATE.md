# PodPDF Website - Business Content Update (v2.0)

## Overview

The website has been updated to reflect PodPDF's **dual approach**: 

**🖥️ Visual Web Application** + **⚡ Developer API**

PodPDF now offers TWO ways to generate professional PDFs:
1. **Web Application** - No coding required, visual drag-and-drop interface
2. **API Integration** - For developers who need automation and programmatic control

**Both methods use the same infrastructure and count toward the same quota.**
