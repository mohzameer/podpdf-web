## 10. Service Availability and Support

### 10.1 Service Level Agreement (SLA)

**Uptime Commitment:**
We commit to maintaining **99.9% uptime** for the PodPDF Service, calculated on a monthly basis.

**SLA Coverage:**
- **Applies to**: Paid Tier Plan 1 and eligible tailored plans
- **Does not apply to**: Free Tier users (best-effort service)
- **Tailored Plans**: SLA eligibility and terms as specified in your plan agreement
- **Measurement Period**: Calendar month
- **Uptime Calculation**: (Total minutes in month - Downtime minutes) / Total minutes in month × 100%

**What Counts as Downtime:**
Downtime is measured when the Service is unavailable and you cannot:
- Access the dashboard at https://app.podpdf.com
- Successfully authenticate to your account
- Generate PDFs via API with valid requests
- Access job history and account information

**What Does NOT Count as Downtime:**
- **Scheduled Maintenance**: Announced at least 48 hours in advance
- **Emergency Maintenance**: Critical security or infrastructure updates
- **Your Network/Systems**: Issues with your internet connection, systems, or infrastructure
- **Third-Party Services**: AWS service outages, Google OAuth outages, or other third-party failures beyond our control
- **Force Majeure**: Natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or other events beyond our reasonable control
- **Your Violations**: Downtime caused by your violation of these Terms
- **Beta Features**: Features marked as beta, experimental, or preview
- **API Client Errors**: Errors caused by invalid requests (4xx HTTP status codes)

### 10.2 SLA Credits and Remedies

If we fail to meet the 99.9% uptime commitment, eligible Paid Tier Plan 1 users and users on tailored plans with SLA guarantees may request SLA credits in the form of **free PDF generation credits**.

**Credit Amounts (Based on Monthly Usage):**
| Monthly Uptime | Credit (% of PDFs Generated That Month) |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| < 99.9% but ≥ 99.0% | 10% of PDFs generated |
| < 99.0% but ≥ 95.0% | 25% of PDFs generated |
| < 95.0% | 50% of PDFs generated |

**Example:**
If you generated 1,000 PDFs in a month where uptime was 98.5% (below 99.0% but above 95.0%), you would receive a credit for 250 free PDFs (25% of 1,000) to use in future months.

**How Credits Work:**
- Credits are calculated based on the number of PDFs you generated during the month when the SLA breach occurred
- Credits are provided as free PDF generation credits (no charge per PDF)
- Credits are automatically applied to your account for future PDF generation
- Each credited PDF is valued at $0.01 (the standard per-PDF rate for Paid Tier Plan 1)

**How to Request Credits:**
1. Email podpdf@gmail.com within 30 days of the incident
2. Include:
   - Your account email
   - Date and time of downtime experienced (with timezone)
   - Description of the issue
   - Evidence of downtime (error messages, screenshots, job IDs that failed)
3. We will investigate and respond within 15 business days
4. If approved, free PDF credits will be added to your account within 5 business days

**Credit Terms:**
- Credits applied as free PDF generation quota to your account
- Credits can be used for any PDF generation (web app or API)
- Credits cannot be redeemed for cash
- Credits expire if not used within 12 months from date of issuance
- Credits are used automatically before charging for new PDFs
- Maximum total credits per year: Equivalent to 50% of your annual PDF generation
- Credits are your sole and exclusive remedy for SLA breaches

**Free Tier Users:**
Free Tier users are not eligible for SLA credits. Service is provided on a best-effort basis without uptime guarantees.

**Tailored Plans:**
SLA credit eligibility for tailored plans is determined by the terms specified in your plan agreement.

### 10.3 Service Availability
